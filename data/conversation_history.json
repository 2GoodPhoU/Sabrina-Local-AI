I'm excited to learn more about your interests, especially AI embodiment, gaming, volleyball, technology advancements, story-driven RPGs, and RTS games. With my adaptive responses and continuous learning capabilities, I'll be able to grow with you and provide a more personalized experience.\n\nLet's get started by first setting up my voice preferences to match the 'Jenny' Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice model you prefer. Additionally, I'll configure my speech speed at 1.0, set my default emotion to \"neutral\", and ensure that I remember previous interactions dynamically with a memory depth of 20. Lastly, I will be listening for your commands constantly thanks to the 'always-on-listening' feature.\n\nOnce we have these settings configured, we can dive deeper into how best to utilize me in integrating AI into your projects and enhancing your smart home setup!"
