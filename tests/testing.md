# Testing System Design and Usage Guide
Now that I've created a comprehensive testing framework for your Sabrina AI system, let me explain how to use it effectively:

# Testing Framework Overview
You now have a robust testing system that includes:

Base Test Framework (tests/test_framework.py): Provides common test infrastructure and utilities for all component tests.
Component-Specific Tests:

tests/test_voice.py: Tests for the Voice API client
tests/test_vision.py: Tests for the Vision Core and OCR
tests/test_automation.py: Tests for the Automation actions
tests/test_integration.py: System-wide integration tests


Test Runner (tests/test_runner.py): A unified script to run all tests with various options.
Pytest Configuration (pytest.ini): Configuration for pytest with test markers.

How to Use the Testing System
Running Basic Tests
To run all non-integration tests (default):
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py
Testing Specific Components
To test only a specific component:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --component voice
python tests/test_runner.py --component vision
python tests/test_runner.py --component automation
Running Integration Tests
Integration tests involve multiple components and may require certain services to be running:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --integration-only
Generating Reports
For HTML test reports:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --html-report
For test coverage reports:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --coverage
Skip Slow Tests
For quicker test runs during development:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --fast
Test Organization
The tests follow a clear organization:

Unit Tests: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
Component Tests: Test the functionality of specific components
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between multiple components
End-to-End Tests: Test the entire system workflow

Tests are also marked with pytest markers:

@pytest.mark.unit: Unit tests (default)
@pytest.mark.integration: Integration tests that may require services running
@pytest.mark.slow: Tests that take a long time to run

Best Practices for Testing Sabrina AI

Run Tests During Development:

During development, focus on fast, unit tests:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --component [your_component] --fast



Before Commits:

Run the full unit test suite:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py



Before Releases:

Run the full test suite including integration tests:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --component all

Generate coverage reports:
bashCopypython tests/test_runner.py --coverage



Adding New Tests:

Extend the appropriate test file for the component you're working on
Inherit from TestBase for access to common test utilities
Use appropriate markers for integration or slow tests



Writing New Tests
When adding new functionality, follow this pattern:

Create a new test method in the appropriate test class
Use descriptive method names starting with test_
Use assertions to validate expected behavior
For integration tests, add the @pytest.mark.integration decorator
For slow tests, add the @pytest.mark.slow decorator

Example:
pythonCopy@pytest.mark.integration
def test_new_voice_feature(self):
    """Test the new voice feature"""
    # Set up test conditions
    ...
    
    # Execute the feature
    result = self.voice_client.new_feature(...)
    
    # Verify the results
    self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)
