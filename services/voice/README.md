- Allow **external applications to request speech synthesis**.
- Provide **authentication & access control** for secure usage.

✅ **Robust Error Handling & Logging**
- Implement **automatic retries** for TTS requests.
- **Fallback voices** if the preferred model is unavailable.
- **Detailed logging system** for debugging and monitoring.

---

### **3️⃣ Project Folder Structure**
The project must follow this structured design:

```
/services/voice/
│-- voice_api.py                  # FastAPI-based Voice API server
│-- voice_api_client.py           # API client for voice interactions
│-- Dockerfile                    # Docker container setup for TTS deployment
│-- docker-compose.yml            # Container orchestration
│-- voice_settings.json           # Config file for voice parameters
│-- voice_docker_requirements.txt # Dependencies for the voice module
│-- README.md                     # Project documentation
│-- setup_guide.md                # Installation and configuration steps
/tests/
│-- voice_module_test.py          # API and TTS testing scripts
/.env                              # Stores API keys and credentials (Git ignored)
```

---

### **4️⃣ Technologies & Dependencies**
💻 **Programming Language:** Python
⚙️ **Core Libraries:**
- **TTS Engine:** Coqui TTS (Jenny Model)
- **API Framework:** FastAPI
- **Audio Processing:** FFmpeg, SoundPlayer
- **Speech Recognition:** Vosk ASR / Whisper
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

---

### **5️⃣ AI Model Selection & Training**
- Use **pre-trained Jenny TTS models** for speech synthesis.
- Optionally fine-tune voice models with **custom datasets**.
- Implement **speaker adaptation** for better personalization.

---

### **6️⃣ API Design & Endpoints**
Create a **FastAPI-based voice API** with the following endpoints:

| **Endpoint**       | **Method** | **Functionality** |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------|
| `/speak`          | `POST`    | Converts text to speech |
| `/voices`         | `GET`     | Lists available voice models |
| `/settings`       | `GET/POST`| Retrieves or updates voice settings |
| `/status`         | `GET`     | Checks if the voice service is running |

Example API Request:
```json
{
  "text": "Hello, I am Sabrina. How can I assist you?",
  "voice": "en_US-amy-medium",
  "speed": 1.2,
  "pitch": 1.0,
  "volume": 0.8
}
```

Expected API Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "audio_url": "/generated_audio/output.wav"
}
```

---

### **7️⃣ Testing & Debugging**
📌 The module must include **comprehensive test scripts** in `/tests/voice_module_test.py`, covering:
✅ **Unit Tests** – Testing individual components (TTS engine, ASR, API requests).
✅ **Integration Tests** – Ensuring all services communicate correctly.
✅ **Load Tests** – Checking how many concurrent requests the module can handle.
✅ **Error Handling Tests** – Simulating API failures and retries.

Example Test Case:
```python
def test_speak_endpoint():
    response = client.post("/speak", json={"text": "Testing voice module"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "audio_url" in response.json()
```

---

### **8️⃣ Deployment & Optimization**
🔹 **Containerization with Docker**
- Use a `Dockerfile` to deploy the service reliably.
- Implement `docker-compose.yml` for managing dependencies.

🔹 **Performance Optimization**
- Use **in-memory caching** to store frequently used speech outputs.
- Implement **asynchronous processing** for handling multiple requests.
- Optimize API response time to **minimize latency**.

---

### **9️⃣ Security & Access Control**
🔐 Implement the following security measures:
- **Use API keys and OAuth2 authentication** for restricting access.
- **Encrypt stored voice settings** to protect user preferences.
- **Ensure compliance** with GDPR/CCPA data protection laws.

---

### **🔹 Deliverables for This AI Module**
✔️ **Fully functional voice module (FastAPI-based service)**
✔️ **Pre-trained Jenny TTS models integrated**
✔️ **Comprehensive API documentation**
✔️ **Test suite ensuring robustness & reliability**
✔️ **Dockerized deployment for consistency**
✔️ **Scalability & future-proofing for AI assistant integration**

---
This **highly detailed prompt** will ensure an AI assistant generates a **full-fledged Voice Module** for **Sabrina AI** with **proper architecture, documentation, API, security, testing, and deployment**. 🚀
